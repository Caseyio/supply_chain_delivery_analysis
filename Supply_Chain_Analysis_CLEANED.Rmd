# Executive Summary

This case study explores on-time delivery performance within a supply chain logistics dataset. Using a combination of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning modeling in R and Python, we set out to identify key drivers behind late shipments and uncover operational insights to reduce delivery risk.

We analyzed over 10,000 records across multiple shipment types, product weights, and delivery channels. Our models achieved up to **68% accuracy**, but the most valuable discovery came through segmentation:  

* **Products under $175 and less than 4 lbs** had a **96.8% on-time delivery rate**, while  
* **Products between 4.5‚Äì8 lbs** showed a **0% late delivery rate**.

Further analysis of transportation modes and warehouse types revealed clear operational patterns within these high-performing segments.

As a result, we recommend optimizing fulfillment routing and inventory placement strategies for light, low-cost items ‚Äî and prioritizing warehouse and mode consistency to further reduce delivery delays.

# Case Study: Predicting Late Deliveries in Supply Chain Logistics

## 1. Problem Statement

Late deliveries reduce customer satisfaction and increase operational
costs. The goal was to analyze supply chain performance data and build a
predictive model to identify which shipments are at risk of arriving
late.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Dataset Overview

-   Dataset: Kaggle ‚Äì E-Commerce Shipping Data\
-   10,999 rows representing individual shipments\
-   Key features: delivery_type, warehouse_type, delivery_priority, weight_lbs\
-   Target variable: `on_time_delivery` (1 = on time, 0 = late)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation

-   Standardized all column names (snake_case)
-   Converted weight from grams to pounds (rounded to 2 decimals)
-   Label-encoded categorical variables
-   Binned `product_cost` and `customer_calls` for pattern discovery
-   Dropped identifier column
-   Exported cleaned dataset for modeling

  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1))

# Rename columns for clarity
data <- data %>%
  rename(
    id = ID,
    warehouse_type = Warehouse_block,
    delivery_type = Mode_of_Shipment,

  )

# Check levels of categorical variables

#Check balance of target variable
table(data$on_time_delivery)
prop.table(table(data$on_time_delivery))

#Reorder Columns
data <- data %>%
  select(on_time_delivery, delivery_priority, delivery_type, everything())

# Export cleaned dataset (optional)
write_csv(data, "train_cleaned.csv")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   On-time delivery rates were surprisingly consistent across priority
    levels, shipment modes, and warehouses
-   Some slight increases in late delivery rates were seen with higher
    product cost and increased customer calls

**Visuals Created:** 

* Product Cost vs Weight: Identified low-cost, low-weight segments with nearly perfect on-time delivery.
* Pie Chart by Delivery Type: Shipments in perfect segments are mostly concentrated in "ship" transportation mode.
* Pie Chart by Warehouse Type: High-performing deliveries are unevenly distributed across warehouse types, offering targeting opportunities.

```{r}
summary(data)
glimpse(data)

#Check late deliveries by category
data %>%
  group_by(delivery_priority, on_time_delivery) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1))

data %>%
  group_by(delivery_type, on_time_delivery) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1))

data %>%
  group_by(warehouse_type, on_time_delivery) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1))

data %>%
  group_by(prior_purchases, on_time_delivery) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count), 1))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

The raw dataset required a series of preprocessing steps to prepare it for modeling. These included:

- Cleaning column names for readability
- Converting weight from grams to pounds
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., warehouse type, shipment mode, delivery priority)
- Binning numerical variables like `product_cost` and `weight_lbs` for visualization
- Creating ordered factors for `delivery_priority` and `customer_review`

These steps were performed in R for data exploration, and replicated in Python to support modeling in the Colab notebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Predictive Modeling (Python)

To complement the exploratory work in R, I built and evaluated a series of classification models in Python using Google Colab.

The workflow included:

- Preprocessing: Label encoding of categorical variables and stratified train-test split
- Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Modeling:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  - **XGBoost Classifier** (with hyperparameter tuning)

The decision tree and tuned XGBoost models achieved the best recall on late deliveries, although overall accuracy plateaued around 68%. Full code, metrics, and visualizations are available in the linked Colab notebook.


### Model Performance (Holdout Set)
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision (Late) | Recall (Late) | F1 Score (Late) |
|--------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Logistic Regression| 63.5%    | 54%              | 58%            | 56%             |
| Decision Tree      | 68.0%    | 56%              | 98%            | 71%             |
| XGBoost (Tuned)    | 67.9%    | 56%              | 98%            | 71%             |

> üîç XGBoost delivered the strongest precision-recall balance after hyperparameter tuning. Feature importance suggested that **product weight** and **cost** were the dominant drivers of delivery performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Final Insights and Recommendations

Data analysis and modeling surfaced several high-value patterns:

### High-Performance Delivery Segments
- Products under **$175 and under 4 lbs** achieved a **96.8% on-time delivery rate**
- Products between **4.5‚Äì8 lbs** showed **0% late deliveries**
- These items clustered around select warehouses (notably Type F) and primarily used ‚ÄúShip‚Äù as delivery mode

### Operational Recommendations
- **Replicate perfect conditions**: Investigate which SKUs fall into this group. Are there packaging, route, or facility advantages that can be scaled?
- **Audit high-performing warehouses**: Type F warehouses had a strong presence in the best-performing segments. Audit these facilities to identify operational best practices. Consider prioritizing their use for high-risk deliveries.
- **Validate delivery mode logic**: ‚ÄúShip‚Äù shipments account for ~70% of the on time deliveries in our subset. Validate how modes (Road, Ship, Flight) are assigned and evaluate average transit times. If shipping mode correlates with geography or warehouse location, re-optimizing routing logic may improve delivery accuracy.

### Strategic Modeling Use
- Use model predictions to **flag high-risk deliveries** based on cost, weight, and discounts ‚Äî deprioritize low-signal features like gender
- Employ business rules post-model to escalate high-priority customer orders, even if model confidence is high


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Next Steps

To operationalize these insights and extend model value:

- **Refine business context**  
  Collaborate with operations teams to validate routing logic, facility constraints, and packaging practices

- **Hyperparameter tuning**  
  Further optimize XGBoost or LightGBM using Optuna to improve recall on late deliveries

- **Enrich the dataset**  
  Add external signals like weather, holidays, region, or real-time delay feeds to boost model accuracy

- **Deploy a real-time dashboard**  
  Use Tableau, Streamlit, or Power BI to surface predicted late deliveries and monitor impact

- **Test model-driven routing decisions**  
  Run A/B tests or operational pilots to evaluate the real-world business impact of acting on predictions

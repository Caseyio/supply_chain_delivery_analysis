# Supply Chain Delivery Analysis

This capstone explores operational drivers of late deliveries using R, Python, and predictive modeling. The project analyzes 11,000+ records to identify key delivery risk patterns and segments.

---

## Project Summary

- Built an end-to-end analytics pipeline to model on-time delivery outcomes.
- Discovered that products under **$175 and 4 lbs** had a **96.8%** on-time rate.
- Used `XGBoost`, `Logistic Regression`, and `Decision Trees` to classify late deliveries with up to **68% accuracy**.
- Designed visuals in `ggplot2` and `seaborn`; final reporting in `R Markdown`.

---

## Key Insights

- **0% late deliveries** for products between **4.5–8 lbs**
- “Ship” mode and warehouse **Type F** were highly represented in perfect delivery segments
- Delivery priority, support calls, and gender were **not significant predictors**
